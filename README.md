# Library API excercise

**Library API excercise** is a golang implement(using go-kit, gorm) of library API

Submitted by: **{{github_user_name}}**

Time spent: **{{time_spent}}** hours spent in total

## Prerequisite

* Must Read about [git flows](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)
* Should read about Postgres database, [go-kit](https://gokit.io/examples/stringsvc.html), [GORM](http://doc.gorm.io/)
* Already Setup: `git`, `golang`, [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

## How to start

* `make local-env`: To create local DB(port: 5432), test DB(port:5439), adminer(tools to view database, port:8080)
* `make clean-local-env`: Turn off `local-env` (be careful it will also clear DB)
* `make dev`: To start server (default port is 3000)
* `make test`: To run test (both integration and unit test)

## User Stories

### Required:
* NOTE:  Each main point should follow `git flows` (each step should have a feature branch,...)

#### Stage 1:

    * email (string)
  * [x] API must be able to get detail of a user.
  * [x] API must be able to get list of users
  * [x] API must be able to create a user
  * [x] API must be able to update a user
  * [x] API must be able to delete a user
* [x] Validate user is correct before (Create/Update):
  * [x] validate name of user is not empty.
  * [x] validate email of user is not empty.
  * [x] validate email of user is a valid email.
  
* [ ] API must be able to CRUD category of books:
  * [ ] Each category should have the following fields:
    * id (uuid)
    * name (string)
  * [ ] API must be able to get detail of a category.
  * [ ] API must be able to get list of categories.
  * [ ] API must be able to create a category.
  * [ ] API must be able to update a category.
  * [ ] API must be able to delete a category.
  * [ ] when delete categories all book belongs to that categories should deleted too.
  
* [ ] Validate category is correct before (Create/Update):
  * [ ] validate name of category is not empty and length > 5 characters.
  * [ ] validate name of category not existed yet (for both create and update).

* [x] API must be able to CRUD books:
  * [x] Each book should have the following fields:
    * id (uuid)
    * name (string)
    * category_id (uuid)
    * author (string)
    * description (string)
  * [x] API must be able to get detail of a book.
  * [x] API must be able to get list of books.
  * [x] API must be able to create a book.
  * [x] API must be able to update a book.
  * [x] API must be able to delete a book.
  
* [x] Validate books is correct before (Create/Update):
  * [x] validate category of a book is exist, if not reject it with error message
  * [x] validate name of a book is not empty and length > 5 characters. if not reject it with error message
  * [x] validate description of a book is not empty and length > 5 characters. if not reject it with error message
  
* [x] API must be able to make action: user lend a book:
  * [x] API should have the following fields:
    * id (uuid)
    * book_id (uuid)
    * user_id (uuid)
    * from (datetime)
    * to (datetime)
  * [x] validate book_id of a book is exist, if not reject it with error message
  * [x] validate user_id of a user is exist, if not reject it with error message
  * [x] validate books is available to lend, if not available reject with error message
  
  
#### Stage 2:

* [x] Add testing for CRUD users:
  * [x] Validation testing (unit test)
  * [x] Endpoint testing (unit test)
  * [x] Database testing (integration)
* [ ] Add testing for CRUD category:
  * [ ] Validation testing
  * [ ] Database testing
* [ ] Add testing for CRUD books:
  * [ ] Validation testing
  * [ ] Database testing
* [ ] Add testing for lending books:
  * [ ] Validation testing
  * [ ] Database testing

### Optional:

*  [ ] List books and filter by name, availables status.
*  [ ] batch create books (create multiple book with 1 API)
*  [ ] batch lending books (user can lending multiple books with 1 api)
*  [ ] implement feature add a tags to books can search book by tag name
*  [ ] implement multiple errors return by an array
